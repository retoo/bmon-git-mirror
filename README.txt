This is a github mirror of bmon, the ncurses based bandwidth monitor, that was
originally written by Thomas Graf <tgraf [at] suug [dot] ch and hosted at
http://www.suug.ch/~tgr/bmon/. 

The page now gives a 404 and therefore I decided to upload it here. The code
you see here is the the 2.0.1 tarball, that debian has mirrored here:
http://packages.debian.org/stable/bmon w/o any patches so far.

I am not claiming any copyright on any of this code, I just like this tool and
wanted to see the code available again.
